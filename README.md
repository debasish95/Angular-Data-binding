# Angular-Data-binding
_--------------------------------


Hello team,

I am writing this mail with a heavy heart that last few weeks has been quite unsettling for me and a decision has to be made before this turns into something more that it should be. It's been 3 years I am working with the team and never have I ever found a place better than this. The decision to put down my paper was well thought, processed and timely. However to take it back was not. I am not able to concentrate on work or even on anything at my personal chores. This was new to me when I thought I could definitely a great work culture, awesome team can have me deprioritise my finances. I realised the margin to financial sacrifices must be limited to maintain a balance in everything. That was a visibility wrong call when I had to take a decision without proper consultation and consideration. This hurts my productivity, my learning velocity and also my impact on the organisation which is not beneficial for both of us in a long run. With all of that said I would request you to reconsider my resignation dated on 12th June 2023 so that I can persue my career with fresh roads. Having said that I understand organisation policy and boundaries to see through an exit process from start to end over two months of notice period. Again I would request my sincere apologies for the inconveniences cause, but the sooner I realise and accept my mistakes the more damage I can control.
